	  <h3>What is Climbing?</h3>
	  <h5><p>Climbing is a sport which originated with the purpose to mountaineer. Later, in the 1970s and 80's, it became more common, and climbing shifted to be about climbing cliff faces in places like Yosemite, Moab, Red River Gorge, etc. Now, climbing has broadened to be indoors, in gyms as well, in a competitive form, but many participate in all disciplines.</p></h5>
	  <h3>What Does Climbing Look Like For Me?</h3>
	  <h5><p>For me, climbing looks like a lot of things. While my preference is to climb outside, particularily sport and trad climbing, as I am still young I largely concentrate my climbing into the competitive scene. When I am older, I hope to transition more to outdoor climbing in beautiful places. Even though I don't climb outside nearly as much as I'd like to, I still get out a lot. Through competitive climbing, I have met many friends who have taken me to some of the most beautiful places to climb. Especially during the summer, I get to go all around my state and surrounding ones to climb in new and exciting places. Climbing for me right now is about the connections I make and the beautiful places I get to see.</p></h5>
